Bootstrap 5 is used along with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

Taking the feedback and newly learned information from class I decided to update the original html and CSS code to better reflect the needs of the assignment. As well as to make it look more cohesive as a whole (mostly the nav). 

Challenges faced: 

While coding the JavaScript portion of this assignment I ran into several issues the main one being how to parse and store the id of each individual Pokémon and use them in snippets of html code using html templates and functions. While I did manage to solve the issue of displaying the capture system of the Pokémon and to have the See More button load more Pokémon, I had a LOT of difficulty getting the information from the https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{id} to show on the popup modal.

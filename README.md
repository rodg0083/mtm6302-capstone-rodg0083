Capstone Project Part 2

My reasoning for the website design: 
For the Capstone project I decided to create a Pokédex website. As per the Pokémon brand I tried to stick with the same recognisable colours, mainly red, white and black, but I also added a few other complementary colours that should give the website a sleek design. In line with that thinking, I also tried to keep the motif of a Pokéball (an iconic symbol for the franchise) throughout the design of the website from the home page to the gallery and description. Meanwhile in homage to the original Pokémon games I tried designing the catching Pokémon interface around the original Pokémon games. As such the fonts I chose also fit the theme using Titles and Headers with the Pokémon Solid front, while using the Pokémon GB for the catching interface (once again referring to the original games) and Nunito or Arial for the body text (as sans-sans fonts are more legible on a screen).

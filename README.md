Bootstrap 5 is used along with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

I first started with the nav styling and setting up the nav links. I then styled the index picture gallery, with bootstrap code. I then used bootstrap cards to create the info card for the selected Pokémon. Afterwards I created the background for the Pokémon catch feature. 

Challenges faced: 
It was interesting trying to think about how to put together the website to think about how it is going to work when creating the JavaScript. 
While creating the image gallery, I realised as I was there was no need for the initial welcome page as it would be redundant. I decided to turn it into a pop-up modal that would explain to the user what the website would be used for. This idea for the feature came last minute so it will be added in the next iteration.  
One particular challenge I faced was/is creating the responsiveness for the catching interface and create animations using shapes, especially when using canvas or svg shapes. I will be adding the animation for the throwing pokeball in the next iteration.
